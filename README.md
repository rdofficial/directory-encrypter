## Directory Encrypter

This tool serves the functionality of serving the encryption and decryption of directories. The tool not only encrypts the root directory as per user specified, but encrypts all the files inside the directory tree, ranging from each sub folders to sub folders within them too. The tool is written in python3 programming language, and their are no other dependencies other than the python interpreter being installed currently in the local machine. The encryption and decryption algorithms uses the old version of character shifting by a special key which is before created from the user entered password.

### Note

* The tool is very rough, there are certain times when during the execution, wrong files may get destroyed by mistake.
* The password for the encryption should be noted down and remembered properly, because without that password, you cannot retrieve back the files.
